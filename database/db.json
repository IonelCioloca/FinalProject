      "description": "In a remote rural region of Tigray, Ethiopia, access to education for girls has historically been extremely limited due to both infrastructure challenges and cultural barriers. This project aimed to construct a safe and fully equipped primary school to serve 120 young girls, providing them with not just classrooms but also access to clean water, hygiene facilities, and a small library. By empowering young girls through education, the initiative hopes to break cycles of poverty, promote gender equality, and create opportunities for future community leadership. Local materials and labor were used in the construction process to ensure community ownership and sustainability.",
